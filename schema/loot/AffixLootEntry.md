# Description
An Affix Loot Entry specifies generation rules for a random itemstack that may be injected into loot tables, or applied at random to naturally spawning entities.  

Note: Invaders and Elites do not use Affix Loot Entries during gear selection, as they rely on Gear Sets.  

# Dependencies
This object references the following objects:
1. [TieredWeights](../tier/TieredWeights.md)
2. [Constraints](../tier/Constraints.md)
3. [ItemStack](../../../../../Placebo/blob/-/schema/ItemStack.md)
4. [LootRarity](./LootRarity.md)

# Schema
```js
{
    "weights": TieredWeights,    // [Mandatory] || The weights for this entry, relative to the other ones.
    "constraints": Constraints,  // [Optional]  || The constraints for this empty. Defaults to no constraints.
    "stack": ItemStack,          // [Mandatory] || The item stack that will be generated by this entry.
    "rarities": [                // [Optional]  || A set of rarities this entry may generate with. When empty, all rarities are used.
        LootRarity
    ]
}
```

Note: Specifying a subset of rarities does not change the weights of those rarities, and it is required that all rarities in the set have a total weight above zero.  

Generally speaking, it is better to not specify custom rarities here, and leave it up to the world tier to decide.
If you do specify them, you should specify the minimum desired rarity and all rarities above that, to ensure smooth progression to higher world tiers.  

# Examples
The Iron Boots entry, which generates in frontier, ascent, and summit.
```json
{
    "type": "apotheosis:affix_loot_entry",
    "rarities": [],
    "stack": {
        "count": 1,
        "id": "minecraft:iron_boots"
    },
    "weights": {
        "frontier": {
            "quality": 1.0,
            "weight": 25
        },
        "ascent": {
            "weight": 10
        },
        "summit": {
            "weight": 10
        }
    }
}
```

The Shield entry, which generates in all world tiers.
```json
{
    "type": "apotheosis:affix_loot_entry",
    "rarities": [],
    "stack": {
        "count": 1,
        "id": "minecraft:shield"
    },
    "weights": {
        "quality": 1.0,
        "weight": 5
    }
}
```
